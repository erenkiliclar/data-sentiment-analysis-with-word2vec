Depending on your computer, there are chances that too many sentences will make your compute slow down, or even freeze - your RAM can overflow. For that reason, **you should start with 10% of the sentences** and see if your computer handles it. Otherwise, rerun with a lower number. \n",

Even in real life, it is recommended that you start with a subset of your data to loop and debug quickly. So increase the number only if you are into getting the best accuracy."
